## DeadLetter.xml
This plugin displays the full name and location of your dead letter target. Currently works for Difficult Customer, Distant Land, and Far Away letters.

## XPTimer.xml
This plugin displays the time since you last 'checked' various XP hotspots. Timers listed beneath the "Death" section have been counting since you saw an NPC death. Timers in the "Visit" section have been counting since GMCP data last showed that room (actually being in the room, WAMG etc).
